# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Alphabet Soup's business team is looking to predict where to make investments. 
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis
### Results
	* Data Processing
		** What variables are considered the target(s) for your model?
		** What variables are considered to be the features of your model?
		** What variables are neither the targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
	* Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
		** How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model and why?
		** Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
		** What steps did you take to try and increase the model performance?

### Summary
#### Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem and explain your recommendation.
